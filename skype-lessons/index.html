				Hi, I'm Bohumír, a software engineer and a music lover. For 10+ years I'm singing in a choir, playing guitar and other instruments and I've been always wondering how stuff works, even in music.</p>
			<p>Alhough I attended classic music lessons for a few many years I've found my way to understand the harmony and acoustic via maths and visualization and eventually I've been creating <a href="http://harmoneye.com/">software</a> to visualize tones in live music.</p>
			<p>Also I've always found the way how music theory is presented hides the surprisingly simple principles under a thick cover of tradition that evolved for centuries.</p>
			
		</div>
		<div class="medium-4 columns">
			
			<p>This unfortunately frightens many people who just want to share their emotions via music and not to memorize strange things. Although some are talented with great hearing almost everybody trains their eyes all the time to absorb a huge amount of visual information.</p>
			<p>So I think it's time to turn music into visual images and be able to see the patterns of what happens in music.</p>
			<p>Now I've decided to create lessons aimed to teach you the important principles of music that can be used in practice for the rest of life - without the clutter and with the help of visualization.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="medium-4 columns">

			<p>Currently the lessons are being born. And you have a unique opportunity to get a personal skype lesson for FREE.</p>
			<p>You're free to ask your own questions and able to shape how the lessons will look like. This offer is limited - you can subscribe and you win a lesson if you're email will be chosen randomly.</p>
			<p>Still you have a decent chance of getting the lesson. What if you aren't lucky to win? Feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TitBpAt1O_z4YqTR62CeoOPyGujmBOJ86fxEu8QB58U/viewform">write me</a> and we can discuss.</p>

			<p>Thank you and I'm looking to hear from you soon. Good luck!</p>

				<h3>The rules of the game</h3>

				<p>If you win we can arrange the actual date and time of the lesson. Since I'm located in the Czech republic and currently working on my own software I'm generally available from about 10 AM to 10 PM CET.</p>

				<div class="panel">
					<ol>
						<li>You can subscribe yourself, ie. at most once per person.</li>
						<li>Automatic or mass subscriptions, as well as subscribing as someone else, will be disqualified.</li>
						<li>The winner will be chosen randomly from all valid entries - about once a week until the game ends.</li>
						<li>If you win I will contact you via the provided email address and we will arrange a date that works well for both of us.</li>
						<li>You can win the lesson at most once.</li>
						<li>If we would arrange a lesson and one of us is not able to attend it due to some unexpected events we can of course arrange the time later.</li>
						<li>What if you liked the lesson and really want more lessons? Well, currently I don't offer paid lessons but we could certainly arrange something to mutual satisfaction. Feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TitBpAt1O_z4YqTR62CeoOPyGujmBOJ86fxEu8QB58U/viewform">contact me</a>.</li>
						<li>I hate spam as you do. This is not a marketing mailing list. I will not sent you commercial offers. However I might sent you a one-time announcement that the lessons are published. If you would like to receive a newsletter there will be a separate mailing list.</li>
						<li>Also I will not pass on your details to any third party without your prior consent.</li>
