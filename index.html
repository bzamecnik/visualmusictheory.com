<p>You can learn the harmony principles visually - in a simple yet expressive way, without the clutter of traditional notation.</p>

<p>In a short time you'll be able to understand the chords and melody of majority of music and be prepared to master any instrument.</p>

<p>Now I offer you a unique chance to win a personal skype lesson for FREE.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Bohumir, a software engineer and a music enthusiast. For 10+ years I'm singing in a choir, play guitar and other instruments and I'm always thinking about how stuff works in music. Even though I attended classic music lessons not for many years I've found my way to understanding the harmony and acoustic via maths and visualization and eventually created software for music visualization.</p>

<p>Also I've always found the way music theory is presented to be hiding the surprisingly simple principles under a thick cover of tradition that evolved for centuries. This unfortunately frightens many people who just want to share their emotions via music and not to memorize strange things. Although some are talented with great hearing almost everybody trains their eyes all the time to absorb a huge amount of visual information. So I think it's time to turn music into visual images and to see the patterns of what happens in music.</p>

<p>Now I've decided to create lessons aimed to teach you the important principles of music that can be used in practice for the rest of life - without the clutter and with the help of visualization.</p>

<p>Currently the lessons are being born. And you have a unique opportunity to get a personal skype lesson for FREE. You're free to ask your own questions and able to shape how the lessons will look like. This offer is limited - you can subscribe and you win a lesson if you're email will be chosen randomly. Still you have a decent chance of getting the lesson. What if you aren't lucky to win? Feel free to write an email to me.</p>

<p>Thank you and I'm looking to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Bohumir</p>
