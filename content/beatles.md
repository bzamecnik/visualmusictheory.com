Here we have 180 wonderful songs by The Beatles. Thanks to the hard work of researchers from the Centre for Digital Music Queen Mary University of London these songs have been annotated by hand and published as the [Reference Annotations: The Beatles](http://isophonics.net/content/reference-annotations-beatles) dataset.

Based on this dataset we'll be gradually [dissecting and analyzing](song-dissections.html) each song in order to find common patterns.
