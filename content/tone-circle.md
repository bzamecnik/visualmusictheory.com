The tone circle diagram a simple and intuitive visual tool that might help you enormously in analyzing harmonic aspects of music, even with just a pen and paper. You already know it. If you understand analog clock, you can understand much of the music theory.

## Clock analogy

Everyone knows *clock*, right? The plain old analog clock dial. Even if it may seem trivial, let's briefly review how it represents time, name the concepts and be aware of them. By the way, music and time have more in common than just a clock (as you'll learn later).

As the time flows - continuosly - a hour *hand* rotates around a circle and points away from the center into some direction. Every once often (precisely every half a day) the hand travels around the whole circle back to the same position. This repeats on an on, ie. it is *periodic*. For this [12-hour clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock) each *period*, in this case a half of a *day*, is split into 12 parts of equal duration - *hours*. A day has 24 hours, the two periods are called <abbr title="ante meridiem - before midday">AM</abbr> and <abbr title="post meridiem - past midday">PM</abbr> and the hand turns around twice a day. On the clock there are marks from 1 to 12 arranged into a circle. Each one represents the duration in full hours since the start of the period (half-day).

</div>

Each half-day starts at midnight/noon 0 AM/PM and the hand points upwards, at 3 the hand points to the right, at 6 down and at 9 left. In the meanwhile the hand moves proportionally in between. This direction of rotation is called *clockwise*. The current time within a half-day is in fact represented by the *[angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_angle_problem)* of the current hand direction to the direction at 0 AM.

Since 12 AM = 0 PM and 12 PM = 0 AM, another possibility would be to have a 0 mark instead of 12 mark. Mathematicians (and C programmers) would love it.

Then of course we can divide each hour into 60 minutes and add a minute hand, and divide each minute into 60 seconds and add a second hand. This hierarchy of periods will be useful later in rhythm. Now in harmony just one level of periodicity will be enough.

In summary, simply said we represent the periodic division of time by a circle. If time is an infinite line, we fold it up into a circle. Instead of moving straight we rotate around, infinitely.

## From clock to tones

Now with those concepts fresh in mind, let's move to the music. One main category of sounds that music is built upon are *[tones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(music))* (By the way, tones themselves are periodic, repeating, sounds). The main attribute that humans perceive about tones is their *[pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music))* - how high or low a tone sounds to our ears. Example tone (flute):

Another category of musical sounds are percussions or beats (like hand claps, drums beats, cymbals, etc.) - no pitch, noisy, short time. Example beat (hand clap):

<iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.freesound.org/embed/sound/iframe/183102/simple/medium/" width="481" height="86"></iframe>

To be more precise by *tones* we mean *harmonic tones* in this article. Tones produced by humans singing, common instruments like piano, guitar, clarinet or violin are mostly harmonic. Still, there exist [non-harmonic tones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre#CITEREFSethares1998) produced by instruments like xylophone or bell for which the classic harmony and the clock analogy do not fit that well.

We will mention some traditional music terminology. It is kind of strange, cluttered and illogical sometimes. For now just don't be scared, you don't need to search for any reason behind it. We'll start with a simple model, link it slowly to the traditional terminology and in further articles cover why that terminology is such and where it came from.

Let's make a few observations and build an analogy between clock and pitches:

1. The range of pitches is theoretically infinite, like time. Altough in practice, our hearing and instruments are [limited to certain range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range).
2. For harmonic tones the perception of pitch is periodic, like for days or half-days in time. Thus we perceive some tones as being equivalent, just like we consider all 2 AM times equivalent no matter what day it is. The period is called *[octave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave)* in the traditional music terminology (for whatever reason for now). All pitches with the same position in an octave are perceived with the same quality. We call it a *[pitch class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class)*.
4. We can divide each octave equally into precisely 12 parts, like hours. Pitch classes at each "hour" are somewhat important in practice and commonly used in music. Each one has some [traditional name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note) (there are multiple naming systems though). Pitches in between are not named usually, but it doesn't mean they're totally ignored.

So that the analogy is:

- pitch is like time
- octave is like half-day
- pitch class is like the relative time within the half-day
- named pitch classes are like hour marks
- actually sounding pitch of a tone is like the current position of the hour hand

Based on this idea we can modify the analog clock a bit to represent the pitch of our tones.

<p class="text-center">

	</a>
</p>

Let us represent the equally-spaced discrete pitch classes by in two common ways:

- numbers from 0 to 11 (like hours from 0 AM to 11 AM)
- traditional pitch class names {C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb, B}

```
0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11
C   Db  D   Eb  E   F   Gb  G   Ab  A  Bb  B
```

The small "b" symbol is traditionally pronounced "flat".

We'll see in other articles where the traditional naming came from and how to map the symbolic names to the actual sounds.

Although there is a continous space of pitches, we'll now limit ourselves to just the 12 named discrete pitch classes (like full hours), ignoring anything in between. It is a simplification of reality but for understanding most of the music theory, that can help us in practice, it would be enough. In cases where continous pitches are important (eg. in blues), we'll use some continuous visualization.

## From one tone to multiple

So far we considered just single tones. Are you happy alone? Tones, like people, are happier when they can interact together. Tones alone are a bit boring. Tones together can make up complex, rich and beutiful music.

Tones can sound together either at the same time (this is called *[harmony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony)*) or in a sequence (*[melody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody)*), or in any combination thereof. Let's focus on the first case - how to visually show multiple tones sounding at once.

For the sake of simplicity let's assume that in the time instant we describe tones at any of the 12 pitch classes either sound (with any musical instrument, at any intensity, octave, etc.) or not. In other words there is a set of sounding pitch classes. A *[pitch class set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory_(music))* is a group of pitch classes where each element is unique and their order is not important.

We can show that visually in the tone circle quite naturally. Just highlight the sounding pitch classes in some way. At that's it.

Here's an example of highlighted pitch classes C, E and G (this is called traditionally the [C major chord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord)):

<p class="text-center">
<img alt="Alarm clock with pitch classes" title="Alarm clock with pitch classes" width="450" src="http://i.visualmusictheory.com/tone-circle/tone_circle_c_e_g.png">
</p>

Using this kind of diagram we can represent many (more precisely 4096 = 2^12) pitch class sets. This includes single tones, two tones at once (called traditionally *intervals*) and multiple tones (*chords*, *scales* or *keys*).

More generally we can represent pitch classes that do not necessarily sound at a single moment, just in some longer time interval, or possibly in the whole song.

We can further explore what operations can we perform on tone circle and try to colorize it in some useful ways. More importantly we'll explore the music theory from the basics with kind handy tool. And eventually we'll possibly extend its usage on the field of rhythm.

## Play with tone circle

Ok, now you know what tone circle is and what it represents. Now you can get your hands dirty and play with it yourself to grasp it more firmly and possibly come up with other questions.

### Pen and paper / whiteboard

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4"><img  src="http://i.visualmusictheory.com/tone-circle/whiteboard_ii-v-i-iv.gif"></div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><img  src="http://i.visualmusictheory.com/tone-circle/whiteboard_dots_c_chord.jpg"></div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><img  src="http://i.visualmusictheory.com/tone-circle/whiteboard_circles_c_diatonic.jpg"></div>
</div>

Just write the names in the circle and then highlight some, eg. by a small circle or by some color.

Tip: to get a nice symmetric circle, first draw the 0, 3, 6, 9 (ie. C, Eb, Gb, A) symbols, then the rest in between. Use a square-grid paper.

Personally I've drawn hundereds of those tone circle diagrams and I recommend it to anyone. Although it needs some work the good thing is you don't need any fancy tools and you are not limited. You can draw multiple tone circles, colorize them, annotate them, write notes, anything.

### Free Android app

Still I wished an easy tool, where I could just set the active pitch classes by touching, rotate the diagram by pinch-rotate gesture and most imporantly a tool that would tell me instantly the chord name. I didn't find anything usable to my need, so that I wrote an Android app myself. It is called [Tone Circle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.harmoneye.tonecircle) (surprisingly) and is available for free (and without ads) on Google Play. The nice green diagram above is a screenshot from the app. The whole article is not meant to be an ad for this app, I just mention it so that it can help you as it helped me.

## Questions arising...

The goal of this article was just to introduce the tone clock visualization of pitch class sets using the clock analogy without going too deep. If you're a curious reader several questions may have arisen in your mind, including the following.

- Should we name pitch classes by numbers or traditional names?
- Why do the traditional pitch class names start at C, not A?
- Why some letters are irregularly duplicated and a small "b" is appended?
- Where is the "#" (sharp) symbol?
- Where are Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si?
- How does pitch relate to frequency?
- Why are you talking about exactly 12 pitch classes? Why not eg. 11 or 19? Does it relate to the *chromatic scale* from music theory or the *[Z_12 group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group)* from algebra?
- Why the named pitch classes were equally distributed? Does it relate to *equal temperament*? Can they be distributed non-equally?
- What's the difference between harmonic and non-harmonic tones?
- Why the 12 equally-spaced pitch classes are not a good model for non-harmonic tones?
- Why the pitch class sets are not ordered when musical *scales* are?
- What about if the tones sounding at once have various intensity?
- How do pitch classes relate to *tunings*?
- Is tone circle visualization meant to replace sheet music?
- What are its pros and cons?
- Is tone circle related to the *circle of fifths*?
- Can we make other circles, like for scales or rythm?

We'll try to explore and answer those questions in the following articles.

## Conclusion

Observation of this analogy is certainly not the first in history (nor it is claimed to be so). Since there is the same structure in music, time tracking and mathematics, it must inevitably be discovered by any person with eyes open again and again. The basic idea is simple, but what's interesting is the actual usage. Thus, I'm happy to share this concept with you and sharpen it further, hoping it will help you as it helped myself.

I'd love to hear from you, how do you feel about it. Feel free to post a comment or tweet about it.

This article is the first in a series that deal with music more visually. Since I consider this tone circle one of the most important tools in studying music theory, by now it is already defined here and can be referenced from any further articles.

It the following articles we'll be exploring music and its theory more practically (also using tone circle) and we'll ask many questions, including why such an analogy can be constructed.
